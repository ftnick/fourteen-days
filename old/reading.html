        <div id="1" class="poem">
            <p>On the first day you will get up from bed and brush your teeth with</p>
            <p>too much toothpaste and get dressed in clothes you never enjoyed</p>
            <p>wearing. You will walk to school and stare at the cracks in the</p>
            <p>sidewalk and the grass jutting out at the sides. The ants will be</p>
            <p>running along where concrete meets pavement, because that will be</p>
            <p>the thing to do. <span class="italic">There is so much there that you have never noticed the</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic">first time around.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div id="2" class="poem">
            <p>On the second day you will get home from school and sit in bed for</p>
            <p>several minutes until they reach seventeen and the forty-first</p>
            <p>second. You will claw at your desk for a pencil, idly trace lines into</p>
            <p>the journal you keep under your pillow, and try not to think about</p>
            <p>the burning in your eyes. Briefly, you will consider scanning the</p>
            <p>room for your phone and wonder if they'd miss you. You will</p>
            <p>instead clutch the pencil tighter and do your homework, because</p>
            <p>that will be the thing to do. <span class="italic">You feel as though your presence is a</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic">burden and that this is all you will ever be.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div id="3" class="poem">
            <p>On the third day you will think about killing yourself tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Maybe the day after tomorrow. Maybe even the day after that. You</p>
            <p>don't think you can make it to the fourth, much less fourteenth.</p>
            <p>You will rake your hands through your hair and, against your better</p>
            <p>judgment, pick up the blade instead of the pen. Instead of word</p>
            <p>after word it will leave cut after cut, and the temporary relief and</p>
            <p>euphoria will only be chased by that sickness in your gut getting</p>
            <p>heavier. You will clean yourself up and act like nothing happened,</p>
            <p>because that will be the thing to do. <span class="italic">It will not change anything, it</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic">has never changed anything.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div id="4" class="poem">
            <p>On the fourth day you will break your first promise to your mother</p>
            <p>and smoke a cigarette. The kids behind the school offered you one,</p>
            <p>and with their eyes on you, staring, watching, waiting, you could</p>
            <p>only choke on your tongue in response. It reminded you of the way</p>
            <p>your parents smoked, the way the ashtray by the window smelled</p>
            <p>and how the smoke gave you an asthma attack when you were</p>
            <p>seven. In the end, you will take one and smoke with them, because</p>
            <p>that will be the thing to do. <span class="italic">Unlike you, they're too cowardly to jump,</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic">so they kill themselves a little every day.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div id="5" class="poem">
            <p>On the fifth day you will stay home, because it is the weekend. The</p>
            <p>comfort of your bed sticks tight to your skin and your eyes feel like</p>
            <p>they have been sewn shut. A notification will ring off your phone,</p>
            <p>or maybe it's an alarm. All the same, at this point, because</p>
            <p>everything means the same thing: get up. You will turn it over from</p>
            <p>where it lies face-down on your pillow, barely even look up, and set</p>
            <p>it back down. Eventually, you will get up, because that will be the</p>
            <p>thing to do. <span class="italic">Comfort is running thin, and you're beginning to find</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic">that it doesn't feel like it used to.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div id="6" class="poem">          
            <p>On the sixth day your patience will run thin. Your temper will get</p>
            <p>worse and you'll think, maybe it is the damn phones. When your</p>
            <p>mother comes up to your room and tells you in that comforting,</p>
            <p>soft voice, your father and I are getting a divorce, there is nothing</p>
            <p>left to feel at all. Your eyes will go blank and your thoughts will</p>
            <p>quiet down for a moment, the prime example of love early on in</p>
            <p>your life falling apart with eight simple words. You will want to</p>
            <p>scream and throw the lamp sitting next to you on the bedside</p>
            <p>cabinet, but instead you will hug her and tell her you love her,</p>
            <p>because that will be the thing to do. <span class="italic">Please be gentle, it is her first</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic">time living too.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div id="7" class="poem">
            <p>On the seventh day you will fall asleep in class. The light fixture</p>
            <p>overhead could fall at the right angle and kill you. You've thought</p>
            <p>about that, hoped for it, even, but rested your head on your arms</p>
            <p>and shut your eyes anyway. The teacher's calls will jerk you awake</p>
            <p>and the class' giggles will ring in your ears for the rest of the day. She</p>
            <p>will ask you a question that you don't know how to answer, for</p>
            <p>everything in your mind is rattled and mismatched and missing,</p>
            <p>and you will sit silently until she gets frustrated and gives you</p>
            <p>detention. Every piece of your mind, as frazzled as it is, will tell you</p>
            <p>to say something back, ask for help, beg her to be kinder, but you</p>
            <p>will say nothing, because that will be the thing to do. <span class="italic">She will skip</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic">by your desk every day after you're dead, and every time her heart</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic">will tug with wonder at how she never noticed.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div id="8" class="poem">       
            <p>On the eighth day before you kill yourself you will cry. It will be</p>
            <p>loud and ugly and your body will wither and shake with sobs. You</p>
            <p>will crumple into a fetal position and turn your head away from</p>
            <p>your mother as she bursts into your room. You haven't cried like</p>
            <p>this before, and haven't cried at all in a very long time. Her</p>
            <p>confusion will dissolve into pity and she will hold you tight and try</p>
            <p>to comfort you as she did before, only you are not a child anymore.</p>
            <p>Every muscle in your body will tense and you will try to rid yourself</p>
            <p>of her and she will hold on anyway, because that will be the thing to</p>
            <p>do. <span class="italic">Despite everything, you are still her child, the object of her love,</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic">and always will be.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div id="9" class="poem">
            <p>On the ninth day you will scroll endlessly through social media</p>
            <p>hoping for something, anything, to give you a glimpse of serotonin.</p>
            <p>You'll find a video of a cat and consider sending it to your sister, but</p>
            <p>the two of you don't talk anymore. The two of you haven't talked</p>
            <p>in a while. You'll get off the app and open up a writing document</p>
            <p>instead. You will type and type and type, but the words are</p>
            <p>incoherent and dizzy on the screen. You will keep writing anyway,</p>
            <p>trying to chase out any feelings of negativity, but will instead hollow</p>
            <p>yourself to not feel a thing. You will get up and go on with your day,</p>
            <p>because that will be the thing to do. <span class="italic">You can never write like you</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic">used to, the only thing you are good for now is to suffer.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div id="10" class="poem">
            <p>On the tenth day your school will hold an assembly about mental</p>
            <p>health. Your friends will all sit together with one spot too little and</p>
            <p>you will move to the front row instead. It doesn't bother you now.</p>
            <p>It's happened too many times to. They will bring in a speaker and</p>
            <p>he will move as he talks and makes grand gestures with both hands.</p>
            <p>He will wear a black t-shirt and jeans and half the school won't be</p>
            <p>paying him any mind. You'll listen, because there's not much else to</p>
            <p>do except listen to the kid next to you breathing through their</p>
            <p>mouth and sniffling every twelve seconds. Eventually they will let</p>
            <p>you go and you will stand up and walk to the door and hesitate.</p>
            <p>There will be a table full of flyers for those who can anonymously</p>
            <p>reach out and talk. Briefly, your hand will hover over it, but you will</p>
            <p>quickly retract it and walk away, because that will be the thing to</p>
            <p>do. <span class="italic">It is not cowardly to need help or to ask for it, and being ill does</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic">not mean you are lesser.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div id="11" class="poem">
            <p>On the eleventh day you will type 'how to kill yourself into your</p>
            <p>browser. Instead of anything helpful, you will find the suicide and</p>
            <p>crisis lifeline. After what feels like hours of hesitation, you will</p>
            <p>slowly click on their website and sign up for a chat with someone.</p>
            <p>You will tell this person that you are thinking of death and they will</p>
            <p>respond in a friendly-enough, blatantly trained way that seems to</p>
            <p>invalidate all the grotesqueness of struggle. You will get more and</p>
            <p>more worked up and then they will ask a question that has yo</p>
            <p>shaking. You will shut off your phone and forget the conversation,</p>
            <p>because that will be the thing to do. <span class="italic">The person's name was Nox, by</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic">the way, and they'll be left wondering if you're alive for the rest of</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic">their life.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div id="12" class="poem">
            <p>On the twelfth day someone close to you will leave unexpectedly.</p>
            <p>It will be for reasons you cannot understand and you will beg them to</p>
            <p>stay. They will leave anyway, and then you promise to yourself that</p>
            <p>you will never stoop as low as you did in that moment just to please</p>
            <p>others. Sooner or later, though, you will break that vow, because</p>
            <p>you are incapable of hurting anyone but yourself. You will take the</p>
            <p>blade for the second time in these two weeks, because that will be</p>
            <p>the thing to do. <span class="italic">You always hurt yourself in the end, and your</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic">self-hate is your most incurable disease.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div id="13" class="poem">
            <p>On the thirteenth day you will go to a carnival and eat popcorn and</p>
            <p>watch the clowns jibber and jibe at one another. You were supposed</p>
            <p>to go with your friends, but they ran off and you don't know where</p>
            <p>they went. You will win a game and get a big teddy bear but give it</p>
            <p>to the kid that's been eyeing it all day. You will never forget the</p>
            <p>smile on their face and a hurried, backwater 'thank you' as they run</p>
            <p>off to their parents. You will try to not let it make you sick, only</p>
            <p>moving on and continuing your day, because that will be the thing</p>
            <p>to do. <span class="italic">That kid will never know you died, and you will never be able</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic">to experience a moment like that again.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div id="14" class="poem">
            <p>On the fourteenth day before you kill yourself you will wake up</p>
            <p>early and make your bed for the first time in months. You will</p>
            <p>shower in cold water, brush your teeth twice, and get dressed in</p>
            <p>clothes you've always liked. You will say goodbye to your pet and</p>
            <p>walk to school. On the way, you will see ants walking along the</p>
            <p>sidewalk cracks and a pencil on the street. You will see a razor blade</p>
            <p>in the grass of someone's lawn and a cigarette butt on the concrete</p>
            <p>of the driveway. You will get tired and almost fall asleep where you</p>
            <p>stand, snapped awake by the thought of your parents. What was</p>
            <p>and what will never be, not anymore. Your thoughts won't make</p>
            <p>sense and you will want to cry, but instead you will take your phone</p>
            <p>from your pocket and scroll as you walk. You'll send that cat video</p>
            <p>to your sister and think of the man from the assembly. You will</p>
            <p>think about how he probably would've gotten along with Nox. You</p>
            <p>will think of how everyone leaves and how sometimes being a child</p>
            <p>and having a giant teddy bear is the greatest feeling in the world.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="15" class="poem">
            <p>On the fourteenth day before you kill yourself you will go to school</p>
            <p>and sit through math and talk to one or two people in English.</p>
            <p>They seem to enjoy your company but you really can't be sure, so</p>
            <p>you get up and leave the instant the bell rings and ignore any other</p>
            <p>conversation they try to share with you.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="16" class="poem">
            <p>On the fourteenth day before you kill yourself you I will walk home,</p>
            <p>slower this time, and sit on your bed for an hour. Not lying, not</p>
            <p>sleeping, just sitting, sitting and wondering. You will eventually</p>
            <p>reach for a sheet of paper and a pen, and will write. You will write</p>
            <p>about struggle, about momentary triumph, about all that there has</p>
            <p>ever been instead of all that there will be. You will be fixed and set</p>
            <p>the paper down and try not to cry but the tears are already boiling</p>
            <p>over. You will set the pen down.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="17" class="poem">
            <p>On the fourteenth day before you kill yourself you will leave your</p>
            <p>house, the note on your bed, and bring nothing with you but the</p>
            <p>clothes on your back and the weight in your chest. You will walk</p>
            <p>and walk and walk until you find something of suitable height.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="18" class="poem">
            <p>On the fourteenth day before you kill yourself you I will stand on</p>
            <p>firm concrete, staring down at something beyond and below. The</p>
            <p>thoughts aren't so dizzy anymore, only a chorus of jump and run.</p>
            <p>You won't be sure which one is louder. The view from above is</p>
            <p>both a bone-chilling nightmare and a simple haze of dreams. Your</p>
            <p>foot will reach the edge, your whole body shaking with nerves and</p>
            <p>incoherence, and you will exhale once. Twice.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="19" class="poem">
            <p>On the fourteenth day before you kill yourself you will jump before</p>
            <p>you can figure out why you shouldn't. You will go as quickly and</p>
            <p>quietly as you thought you would, and they won't find your body</p>
            <p>until the next morning. You will forget yourself as you fall, and you</p>
            <p>will die before you can second-guess it. You will leave this world</p>
            <p>thinking of your mother, because that will be the thing to do. <span class="italic">There</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic">are no words of comfort where you are going, only the wind whipping</span></p>
