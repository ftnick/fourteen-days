            <h1>how to kill youself in fourteen days</h1>

            <div id="1" class="poem">
                <p>On the first day you will get up from bed and brush your teeth with</p>
                <p>too much toothpaste and get dressed in clothes you never enjoyed</p>
                <p>wearing. You will walk to school and stare at the cracks in the</p>
                <p>sidewalk and the grass jutting out at the sides. The ants will be</p>
                <p>running along where concrete meets pavement, because that will be</p>
                <p>the thing to do. <span class="italic">There is so much there that you have never noticed the</span></p>
                <p><span class="italic">first time around.</span></p>
            </div>

            <div id="2" class="poem">
                <p>On the second day you will get home from school and sit in bed for</p>
                <p>several minutes until they reach seventeen and the forty-first</p>
                <p>second. You will claw at your desk for a pencil, idly trace lines into</p>
                <p>the journal you keep under your pillow, and try not to think about</p>
                <p>the burning in your eyes. Briefly, you will consider scanning the</p>
                <p>room for your phone and wonder if they'd miss you. You will</p>
                <p>instead clutch the pencil tighter and do your homework, because</p>
                <p>that will be the thing to do. <span class="italic">You feel as though your presence is a</span></p>
                <p><span class="italic">burden and that this is all you will ever be.</span></p>
            </div>

            <div id="3" class="poem">
                <p>On the third day you will think about killing yourself tomorrow.</p>
                <p>Maybe the day after tomorrow. Maybe even the day after that. You</p>
                <p>don't think you can make it to the fourth, much less fourteenth.</p>
                <p>You will rake your hands through your hair and, against your better</p>
                <p>judgment, pick up the blade instead of the pen. Instead of word</p>
                <p>after word it will leave cut after cut, and the temporary relief and</p>
                <p>euphoria will only be chased by that sickness in your gut getting</p>
                <p>heavier. You will clean yourself up and act like nothing happened,</p>
                <p>because that will be the thing to do. <span class="italic">It will not change anything, it</span></p>
                <p><span class="italic">has never changed anything.</span></p>
            </div>

            <div id="4" class="poem">
                <p>On the fourth day you will break your first promise to your mother</p>
                <p>and smoke a cigarette. The kids behind the school offered you one,</p>
                <p>and with their eyes on you, staring, watching, waiting, you could</p>
                <p>only choke on your tongue in response. It reminded you of the way</p>
                <p>your parents smoked, the way the ashtray by the window smelled</p>
                <p>and how the smoke gave you an asthma attack when you were</p>
                <p>seven. In the end, you will take one and smoke with them, because</p>
                <p>that will be the thing to do. <span class="italic">Unlike you, they're too cowardly to jump,</span></p>
                <p><span class="italic">so they kill themselves a little every day.</span></p>
            </div>

            <div id="5" class="poem">
                <p>On the fifth day you will stay home, because it is the weekend. The</p>
                <p>comfort of your bed sticks tight to your skin and your eyes feel like</p>
                <p>they have been sewn shut. A notification will ring off your phone,</p>
                <p>or maybe it's an alarm. All the same, at this point, because</p>
                <p>everything means the same thing: get up. You will turn it over from</p>
                <p>where it lies face-down on your pillow, barely even look up, and set</p>
                <p>it back down. Eventually, you will get up, because that will be the</p>
                <p>thing to do. <span class="italic">Comfort is running thin, and you're beginning to find</span></p>
                <p><span class="italic">that it doesn't feel like it used to.</span></p>
            </div>

            <div id="6" class="poem">          
                <p>On the sixth day your patience will run thin. Your temper will get</p>
                <p>worse and you'll think, maybe it is the damn phones. When your</p>
                <p>mother comes up to your room and tells you in that comforting,</p>
                <p>soft voice, your father and I are getting a divorce, there is nothing</p>
                <p>left to feel at all. Your eyes will go blank and your thoughts will</p>
                <p>quiet down for a moment, the prime example of love early on in</p>
                <p>your life falling apart with eight simple words. You will want to</p>
                <p>scream and throw the lamp sitting next to you on the bedside</p>
                <p>cabinet, but instead you will hug her and tell her you love her,</p>
                <p>because that will be the thing to do. <span class="italic">Please be gentle, it is her first</span></p>
                <p><span class="italic">time living too.</span></p>
            </div>

            <div id="7" class="poem">
                <p>On the seventh day you will fall asleep in class. The light fixture</p>
                <p>overhead could fall at the right angle and kill you. You've thought</p>
                <p>about that, hoped for it, even, but rested your head on your arms</p>
                <p>and shut your eyes anyway. The teacher's calls will jerk you awake</p>
                <p>and the class' giggles will ring in your ears for the rest of the day. She</p>
                <p>will ask you a question that you don't know how to answer, for</p>
                <p>everything in your mind is rattled and mismatched and missing,</p>
                <p>and you will sit silently until she gets frustrated and gives you</p>
                <p>detention. Every piece of your mind, as frazzled as it is, will tell you</p>
                <p>to say something back, ask for help, beg her to be kinder, but you</p>
                <p>will say nothing, because that will be the thing to do. <span class="italic">She will skip</span></p>
                <p><span class="italic">by your desk every day after you're dead, and every time her heart</span></p>
                <p><span class="italic">will tug with wonder at how she never noticed.</span></p>
            </div>
